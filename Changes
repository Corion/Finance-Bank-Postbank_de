Revision history for Perl extension Finance::Bank::Postbank_de.

0.24
  - Another small HTML change, thankfully reported by
    Reto Heygel

0.23 20060327
  - Moved to Test::Inline 2.x
  - Cleaned up MANIFEST

0.22 20050928
  - Postbank changed their layout again and added yet another
    advisory page that must be skipped.

0.21 20050413
  - Markus Preis informed me of two changes to the Postbank
    layout even before I noticed them! Thanks Markus!

0.20 20041113
  - Moved to the new web interface and hopefully didn't break anything
  ! The account accessor C<name> is now different from C<number> !!!
    They used both to contain the account number but now the name
    contains the name of the account owner(s).
  ! White space in the comment fields may have changed positions!
  ! White space at the end of fields is stripped! This is different
    from the files you download directly from the web interface!
  ! The type names have changed:
      'GUTSCHRIFT' 	=>  'Gutschrift'
      'ÜBERWEISUNG'  =>   "\xfcberweisung"
      'SCHECK'		=>   "Scheckeinreichung"
      'LASTSCHRIFT'	=>   "Lastschrift"
      'INH. SCHECK'	=>   "Inh. Scheck"
    The names are passed through directly so you will need to adapt
    your program(s).
  ! The postbank now fills in more fields (sender/receiver) all the time.
  ! The credit card accounts are not returned!!
  ! The two embedded tests fail, but I don't know why :-(

0.11 20041108
  - Fixed erroneous skip count in t/02-maintenance.t.
    This bogus failure was only triggered when no SSL capability
    is available.
  - The Postbank changed the look of their website. I cheated and
    use the old, 'classic' HTML interface.

0.10 20040904
  - The Postbank changed their certificate, which rightfully tripped
    up the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header.

0.09 20031108
  - Added List::Sliding::Changes as a hard prerequisite. It's only
    needed for the examples, but I grew tired of the bug reports.
  - Added certificate checking through LWP If-SSL-Cert-Subject header
  - now needs WWW::Mechanize v0.64 due to autocheck => 1

0.08 20031107
  - The error number for wrong PIN changed from 10011 to 9501
  - The maintenance screen now got an error number: 5010
  - The tests now dump html files if they don't match expectations
  - added test to check for maintenance mode detection
  - the $agent now moves to the previous page after downloading stuff

0.07 20030520
  - Thanks to Markus Preis for reporting the bugs fixed in this release
  - Fixed Finance::Postbank_de::Account synopsis
  - Added test and fix for negative account balance ...
  - Added tests to actually test the Synopsis of both modules

0.06 20030207
  - Restructured ::Postbank_de::Account::transactions()
  - Introduced some aliases for field names
  - talked to Briac Pilpre about moving to common Account / Transaction classes
  - One synopsis example is possibly still failing under Perl 5.8, but I can't
    confirm / reproduce it
  - hopefully fixed the inline tests so that they work under Perl 5.8

0.05 20030206
  - Fixed inline POD tests/examples (how I hate broken synopsis code)
  - Added access_denied() to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de
  - Added error_page() to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de for generic error recognition

0.04 20030204
  - Revamped tests to include the examples
  - Examples use List::Sliding::Changes

0.03 20030126
  - Updated dependencies of the test files in Makefile.PL
  - Different handling of EOL for better compatibility with Unix

0.02 20030123
  - Added checking for https capability of LWP to all tests
  - Name change from Finance::Bank::Postbank to Finance::Bank::Postbank_de due to
    conflicting different bank in the netherlands with the same name
